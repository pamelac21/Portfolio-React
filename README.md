# Portfolio

It is..
A professional portfolio to showcase skills 
and talents to employers.

Features..
Focus on new skills: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

Description..
I used HTML & CSS to create a professional portfolio that showcases the work I have done. 
It includes my name and a photo. I included internal links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me. 
The work section includes titled images of my applications, with emphasis on the first one. 
I used flexbox and external links so when you click on an application you are taken to it's site.
I used media queries to make the layout responsive to different screen sizes.

As this site is to be updated, I left a lot of room and placeholders to be filled in as projects
are completed.
