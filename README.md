## Installation and Setup

1. Installation: `npm install`

2. In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Usage

You'll be able to run the app locally by running npm start:
```
npm start
```
All your changes should update the local host in real time. If you want to deploy your app, you'll need to make a few changes to the package.json file. Directions below for deploying to Github Pages:

1. Add a homepage: <name-of-the-page-deploying-to> to your package.json
  ```
  "homepage": "https://<account-name>.github.io/react-portfolio/"
  ```
2. In the "scripts" property of your package.json, add two scripts:

3. Now, after you merge your changes and pull the most up-to-date master, open a new terminal and run npm run deploy:
```
npm run deploy
```
  
4. This creates a new branch, gh-pages. Open your deploy settings in Github and change the deploy branch to gh-pages

5. Every time you want your deployed site to update with the changes you've made, you need to run npm run deploy
